            COVID-19 could affect the global economy in three main ways: by directly affecting production, 
            by creating supply chain and market disruption, and by its financial impact on firms and financial 
            markets. However, a great deal depends on the public’s reaction to the disease.The objective of this
             paper is to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian economy in the short term and the long term.
              The research question being addressed is What will be the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian economy in
               the short term and the long term? A decision-tree approach has been adopted for doing the projections 
               that spell out the impact. Different scenarios have been considered for assessment of the economic impact.
                These scenarios have been constructed to follow the generally adopted standard pattern of ‘best’, ‘middle’ 
                and ‘worst’ (Hyndman & Athanasopoulos, 2018). In most of the projections, a scenario framework of strong,
                 moderate and weak recovery of the economy has been considered in line with the three general options that are used.

            The economic impact of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in India has been largely disruptive. India's
             growth in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2020 went down to 3.1% according to the Ministry of
              Statistics. The Chief Economic Adviser to the Government of India said that this drop is mainly due 
              to the coronavirus pandemic effect on the Indian economy. Notably India had also been witnessing a 
              pre-pandemic slowdown, and according to the World Bank, the current pandemic has "magnified pre-existing 
              risks to India's economic outlook".

        <h1>Economic impact</h1>
        <h3>1.Direct impact on production</h3>
        <p>
            Chinese production has already been substantially affected by the shutdown in Hubei
             province and other areas. Some other countries are also beginning to feel a direct 
             impact as their authorities put in place similar measures.The slowdown in China has 
             effects on exporters to China. China’s largest sources of imports are Korea, Japan, 
             and other Asian countries, according to the World Bank.2 Thus, even without new 
             outbreaks of the disease, these areas will likely experience slow growth in the first half of 2020.
             Beyond its impact on the lives of millions of people all over the world, the new coronavirus
              pandemic has also dealt a heavy blow to economic growth on a global level. Although the governments 
              of the main countries to be shaken by the Covid-19 crisis have launched measures to palliate the 
              economic slowdown caused by this virus, it is foreseen that its spread could have a triple effect on 
              the global economy: direct impact on global production volumes; disruptions and disorder in supply and 
              distribution chains; and financial impact on companies and the stock market.
              The temporary disruptions in the production of goods and components could put a strain on some
               companies, particularly on companies with insufficient solvency. The impact on the markets will
                materialize itself as negative assessments and an increase in risk. In turn, the consequent increase
                 in risk will be translated into investment positions that will be unprofitable under the current 
                 conditions, which will weaken the trust in financial markets and instruments even further.
        </p>
    </section>
      
    <section>
        <h3>2.Supply chain and market disruption</h3>
        <p>
            Many manufacturing firms rely on imported intermediate inputs from China and other countries 
            affected by the disease. Many companies also rely on sales in China to meet financial goals.
             The slowdown in economic activity—and transportation restrictions—in affected countries 
             will likely have an impact on the production and profitability of specific global companies, 
             particularly in manufacturing and in raw materials used in manufacturing. For companies that
              rely on intermediate goods from affected regions, and that are not able to easily switch sourcing, 
              the size of the impact may depend on how quickly the outbreak fades. Small and medium-sized firms
               may have greater difficulty surviving the disruption. Businesses tied to travel and tourism are
                facing losses that are likely not recoverable.The spread of the new coronavirus, COVID-19, 
                is being felt globally across operations in ways that are difficult to model and assess. The
                 affected regions are at the heart of many global supply chains. Hard information is lacking; 
                 concerns are mounting over depleting (or idling) stock; and companies fear they won’t meet contractual obligations on time.
                 Understanding how global manufacturers are managing through disruptions to their supply chains will help 
                 all businesses structure their own responses. Impacts in many companies across many industries seem inevitable. 
                 In the near term, the cost of supplies from China may increase, stemming from overtime and expedited freight costs,
                  as well as from paying premiums to buy up supply and hold capacity. Companies are also working through alternative 
                  sourcing strategies. It will be critical to identify alternative supply scenarios and evaluate what these mean for operations — 
                  for example, as cases of viral transmission emerge in different territories.


        </p>

        <h3>3.Financial impact on firms and financial markets</h3>
        <p>
            Temporary disruptions of inputs and/or production might stress some firms, particularly those 
            with inadequate liquidity. Traders in financial markets may or may not correctly anticipate or 
            understand which firms might be vulnerable. The resulting rise in risk might reveal that one or 
            more key financial market players have taken investment positions that are unprofitable under 
            current conditions, further weakening trust in financial instruments and markets. A possible 
            (likely low-probability) event would be a significant financial market disruption as participants
             become concerned about counterparty risk. A somewhat more likely possibility is a significant decline 
             in equity markets and corporate bond markets, with investors preferring to hold government securities 
             (particularly US treasuries) because of the uncertainty created by the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the Covid-19 pandemic subsides, the world is going to look markedly different. The supply shock that started
             in China in February and the demand shock that followed as the global economy shut down exposed vulnerabilities in the 
             production strategies and supply chains of firms just about everywhere. Temporary trade restrictions and shortages of pharmaceuticals,
             critical medical supplies, and other products highlighted their weaknesses. Those developments, combined with the U.S.-China trade war, 
             have triggered a rise in economic nationalism. As a consequence of all this, manufacturers worldwide are going to be under greater political
             and competitive pressures to increase their domestic production, grow employment in their home countries, reduce or even eliminate their 
                dependence on sources that are perceived as risky, and rethink their use of lean manufacturing strategies that involve minimizing the amount
               of inventory held in their global supply chains.

        <h1>Scenarios</h1>
        <h3>1.The worst is over</h3>
        <p>Transmission in China has slowed already. Although some isolated outbreaks occur elsewhere, these
             do not create a massive spread of the disease. As the global number of cases stabilizes, China’s
              economy returns to normal, and there is little impact outside of some areas such as Iran that 
              are not important for the global economy. China’s GDP takes a big hit in Q1 2020 but bounces back 
              in Q2 and Q3—although some of the lost production is never replaced. Specific companies outside China
               experience short-term supply disruptions, but the impact on the global economy is small and temporary.
               When this corona interlude is finally done, what will be our most vivid memory of it? My answer, 
               I’m coming to believe, is reading. Specifically, reading about corona. Every day there’s stuff being 
               written and circulated about the pandemic: people wearing masks or not, the mathematics of growth and 
               lockdowns, the search for a vaccine, the competence or otherwise of various world leaders as they face up 
               to the disease, plenty more. In fact, I’ve given up trying to keep up with everything that comes my way. 
               I’d need 30 hours a day, minimum, to do so, and which of us have that kind of time? But I’ve been holding on to 
               one article that someone sent me early in the pandemic, perhaps in early April. Something told me it would be 
               good to revisit it in several weeks, if the pandemic did indeed last that long. That “if" is itself a testament
                to how we viewed covid then, back in those days when we had only a couple of thousand cases in India and it was 
                possible to imagine we’d never be as badly hit as China or Italy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The study states that there is a significant dearth of good data on Indian cases largely because testing remains low. 
            As of Wednesday evening, the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) had conducted just over 25,000 tests, way under
             the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO). Extensive testing, such as the approach in South Korea, is 
             essential to get a handle on the situation and uncover positive cases and isolate them. Given that testing remains low,
              the group said that their projections may be underestimations.India officially has 0.7 hospital beds per 1,000 people
               but even at the best of times, the reality is probably 75% of this figure - not taking into account beds that are 
               already occupied. Only around 5-10% of these are ICU units with ventilator support. Further, India has a substantial
                number of people considered at risk of COVID-19 making them severely sick; over 300 million suffer from hypertension,
                 over 122 million suffer from diabetes and more than 70 million suffer from asthma and COPD respectively (note that
                  some people will have multiple underlying conditions as well, so there will be significant overlap in these numbers).

        <h3>2.Year of the virus</h3>
        <p>Although the spread of the disease in China slows, outbreaks occur on a rolling basis around the world. 
            Each outbreak requires slowing production in that area, and in a globalized world, that means rolling
             disruptions to different regions and industries as outbreaks occur and are controlled. The overall impact
              is to disrupt economic activity enough to slow global growth substantially. Businesses that are nimble 
              enough to manage switching suppliers and that have enough liquidity to survive periods of low sales and
               revenue will have a competitive advantage.The Covid-19 pandemic has over the past year put a lot of stress 
               on mental health. A sudden change in lifestyle due to lockdown, work from home, social distancing and the 
               threat of the virus looming have made people worried and this is taking a toll on their mental health. 
               The worst affected are those who are battling the Covid-19 virus. Several studies have shown that such 
               patients have more chances of developing mental health problems than others.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>3.Global pandemic response</h3>
        <p>Economic centers around the world are subject to Wuhan-style shutdowns as people panic over the spread of 
            the virus. Uncoordinated decisions on a country-by-country basis disrupt the movement of both people and goods.
             Global manufacturing declines, as businesses with international supply chains can operate only intermittently. 
             Tourism and related businesses decline sharply, and tourism-based businesses and regions suffer. It takes more than
              a year for the World Health Organization and the United Nations to develop an accepted global response that
               prioritizes health measures based on effectiveness and cost to the wider economy, and for this response to 
               be accepted in the major world economies. Global GDP stagnates, international trade falls, and a global 
               recession is a distinct possibility.NIAID COVID-19 research efforts build on earlier research on severe 
               acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which also are caused by 
               coronaviruses. MERS is a viral respiratory disease that was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September 
               2012 and has since spread to 27 countries, according to the World Health Organization. Some people infected
                with MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) develop severe acute respiratory illness, including fever, cough, and 
                shortness of breath. From its emergence through January 2020, WHO confirmed 2,519 MERS cases and 866 deaths 
                (about 1 in 3). Among all reported cases in people, about 80% have occurred in Saudi Arabia. Only two people 
                in the United States have tested positive for MERS-CoV, both of whom recovered. They were healthcare provider
                 who lived in Saudi Arabia, where they likely were infected before traveling to the U.S., according to the CDC.
                 In January 2020, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the cause of an outbreak of viral pneumonia
                  in Wuhan, China. The disease, later named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), subsequently spread globally. 
                  In the first three months after COVID-19 emerged nearly 1 million people were infected and 50,000 died.
                  By six months the number of cases exceeded 10 million and there were more than 500,000 deaths.
                   One of the troubling observations about COVID-19 is that people who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 – some
                    scientists estimate up to 40% -- can transmit the virus to others before they have symptoms or without 
                    ever having symptoms of disease.</p>
